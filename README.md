This repository contains computer vision projects. Each directory in this repository contains a README.txt describing
each project. Each directory has a "report" named "hw<x>_report" detailing what the assignment was about. The
directories may also contain source code related to the assignment.
Some of the computer vision methods and techniques that were used include Otsu's method, Canny's edge detection
