This repository contains computer vision projects. Each directory in this repository contains a README.txt describing
each project. Each directory has a "report" named "hw<x>_report" detailing the results or the findings of the assignment. The
directories may also contain java source code relating to the assignment. If the directories do contain source, they can be imported within the Eclipse IDE as an Eclipse project. Some of the computer vision methods and techniques that were used include Otsu's method, Canny's edge detection
algorithmn, morphology operators, Frei-chen basis vectors, photometric stereo, etc.
